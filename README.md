## The End Result
![Screenshot](Images/Desktop_pic.png)
This is the setup I found worked for my needs the most. It can be much more stripped down or even more complex depending on your needs. Once you are done this you will be able to customize the config to suit your needs.
## Overview
### Time Investment
It shouldn't take you anymore than an hour to complete this setup. If you decide to customize after that be prepared to google
### Programs Running
Now to get to the meat and potatoes of the config... What is being utilized?
- Qtile
- picom for transparency effects and rounded corners
- Fish shell (my preferred shell)
- kitty (my preferred terminal)
- htop as my system monitor
- nitrogen for wallpapers
- spictify for nice spotify
- conky for shortcuts quick reference 
- micro as a text editor
- rofi as a launcher
- pywal which will set background and automatically adjust colours (bundled with pywalfox for firefox colours)
